# http_status

A little script for checking the HTTP status of a domain. 

Be sure to install the required libs before running:

    `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

Run with the sample files as such:

    python http_status.py --input sample/domains.txt --output sample/results.txt

Insert lots of caveats about forwarding, input validation, performance enhancements, improving things by parallelizing, etc.
